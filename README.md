# Banker's Algorithm Implementation

This project implements the Banker's algorithm for resource allocation in an operating system. The Banker's algorithm is used to ensure that a system does not enter an unsafe state while allocating resources to different processes.

## Description

The code is written in Java and designed as an Android activity. It allows the user to input information about the currently allocated resources, maximum resources, total system resources, and available resources. The user can also select a process and a resource, along with the number of resources needed, and submit the request.

The main components of the code include:
- The `MainActivity` class, which serves as the entry point for the Android activity.
- Methods for reading user input, including `read_maximum_resources`, `read_currently_resources`, `read_total_resources`, and `read_available_resource`.
- The `submit` method, which is triggered when the user submits the resource request. It calls the `read_request` method to update the resource allocation and then applies the Banker's algorithm by calling the `banker_algorithm` method.
- The `banker_algorithm` method, which recursively checks if the system is in a safe state by iterating over the processes and their resource requirements.

## Usage

To use the code, you need to have an Android development environment set up. Here are the general steps:

1. Set up an Android development environment, such as Android Studio.
2. Create a new Android project or open an existing project.
3. Copy the provided code into the appropriate files in your Android project.
4. Make sure you have the necessary XML layout files and imports to support the code.
5. Build and run the Android project on an emulator or physical device.
